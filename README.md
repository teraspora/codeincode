# codeincode

## Overview

Codeincode is a playground for encoding and decoding, encrypting and decrypting, converting strings into other forms and back again.

## Initial goals

    - Encode a textual message invisibly in a photograph(jpeg or png file)
    - Decode the message from the photo
    - Play with some forms of encryption and password protection

## First steps

    - Create two functions which convert between string and integer; also provide two functions that handle the intermediate bitstring representation, the easiest form for use in pixel processing.
